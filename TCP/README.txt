No specific notes for the project. All required functionality should be completed, no additional functionality was added. initial work was done by John, it was overhauled for part A by Sarah. Sarah coded basic ACKing of packets, and the responses were coded by John for part B. preliminary closing was done by Sarah and finished by John to complete the required work. Overall an equal distribution of work.
